#### Brief Description of Project - 
###### This is an institute management system. We have found a client who wants a web application for her institute. Basically, our client wants a system for manage her institute and manage teachers who are working in that institute as well as the students who are learning from that institute. The main purpose of this is to give students and teachers the opportunity to work easily and quickly due to the use of web application rather than doing it manually. In order to maintain such database and even to handle such kind of large activities, we need to have some automatically working web application, which does not require much manual work and can be done easily.

#### Technologies used - Frontend - HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript
####                     Backend  - Laravel
####                     Database - MySql
